Thanks for checking out my Amazon Supplement Analysis project!

This was a a final project for my DS3000 class at Northeastern University in Spring of 2021, taught by Piotr Sapiezynski (sapiezynski.com). I worked on the project with three partners: Rachna Lewis, Jinquian "Sunny" Sun and Garrett Smith. The purpose of the project was to extract relevant data from Amazon supplement product pages and see if we could find a linear regression equation that could predict either sales revenue, sales count or product ranking with a positive r-squared value. Our sales revenue and sales count estimations were based on product price, number of reviews and days since publication (this specifics are included in the .ipynb file). 

This project gave me experience in web scraping, data manipulation, and linear regression, and we succeeded in creating a linear regression algorithm that predicted sales count with an r-squared of 0.05.
