About this item



3X BETTER ABSORPTION THAN REGULAR [2] CoQ10. Clinical trials have proven that no other CoQ10 supplement absorbs better than Qunol. In fact, Qunol Ultra absorbs 3X better than regular [2] CoQ10.



#1 CARDIOLOGIST RECOMMENDED FORM OF COQ10. With superior absorption compared to regular [2] CoQ10, Qunol 100mg CoQ10 softgel capsules can help you reach optimal levels of Coenzyme Q10 sooner, so you can experience the potential benefits faster.



100% WATER AND FAT-SOLUBLE, Qunol CoQ10's patented formulation is 100% water and fat-soluble, unlike regular [2] CoQ10 that does not dissolve in water and dissolves very poorly in fat.



BENEFICIAL TO STATIN DRUG USERS. Statin medications have been shown to lower CoQ10 levels and the addition of a CoQ10 supplement to statin drug therapy can help replenish lost CoQ12



ESSENTIAL FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION. CoQ10 plays a vital role in the production of energy in the body. Taking a CoQ10 supplement helps increase natural CoQ10 levels that can be depleted by age and cholesterol-lowering statin medications.



During the summer months products may arrive warm but Amazon stores and ships products in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations, when provided.

Two-In-One Formula | Adrenal & Thyroid Support - Because the adrenal glands and thyroid work closely together, we were shocked to find that no supplements support both. So we developed one that did. WellPath Soothe was expertly developed to include powerful natural ingredients that help fight complexes like adrenal fatigue and thyroid irregularities.

Herbal Ingredient Formula - Our adrenal and thyroid support formula is handpicked by experts to help regulate and balance our bodies. Our formula includes Ashwagandha Root extract, an Ayurvedic herb famed for balancing stress; Eleuthero, an herb known for regulating cortisol levels, the energy boosting Rhodiola Rosea, L-Tyrosine, Selenium, Kelp and more.



Safety & Quality Are Our Top Priority - Soothe is entirely non-GMO, gluten free, and soy free in a vegetarian capsule. It is third-party tested and manufactured in a GMP-certified facility.

About this item



3X BETTER ABSORPTION THAN REGULAR [2] CoQ10. Clinical trials have proven that no other CoQ10 supplement absorbs better than Qunol. In fact, Qunol Ultra absorbs 3X better than regular [2] CoQ10.



#1 CARDIOLOGIST RECOMMENDED FORM OF COQ10. With superior absorption compared to regular [2] CoQ10, Qunol 100mg CoQ10 softgel capsules can help you reach optimal levels of Coenzyme Q10 sooner, so you can experience the potential benefits faster.



100% WATER AND FAT-SOLUBLE, Qunol CoQ10's patented formulation is 100% water and fat-soluble, unlike regular [2] CoQ10 that does not dissolve in water and dissolves very poorly in fat.



BENEFICIAL TO STATIN DRUG USERS. Statin medications have been shown to lower CoQ10 levels and the addition of a CoQ10 supplement to statin drug therapy can help replenish lost CoQ12



ESSENTIAL FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION. CoQ10 plays a vital role in the production of energy in the body. Taking a CoQ10 supplement helps increase natural CoQ10 levels that can be depleted by age and cholesterol-lowering statin medications.



During the summer months products may arrive warm but Amazon stores and ships products in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations, when provided.

About this item



The most active form of hyaluronic acid: Toniiq Hyaluronic Acid capsules contain 250mg of the highest quality hyaluronic acid powder in each capsule– ethically sourced, grown and produced using a fermented production process to ensure 95% standardized purity (most hyaluronic acid supplement products won't even disclose their level of purity). Higher purity hyaluronic acid means higher absorption and bioavailability.*



A key active ingredient: Our hyaluronic acid comes from a production process that is 100% Non-GMO and vegan-friendly. It is produced using a state-of-the-art extraction process to ensure the utmost purity, quality, and potency, and combined with ascorbic vitamin C to even further increase its bioavailability.



Non-GMO fermentation: Our hyaluronic acid supplement is derived via a fermentation process to ensure an all-natural and highly stable formula. Purity is attained using an advanced distillation process that involves fermentation, centrifugation, cell extraction, filtration, and crystallization. Due to its high purity, our hyaluronic acid has an exceptionally high level of bioavailability.



Each batch is individually tested: We test each batch both ourselves and through a third-party independent laboratory to ensure our hyaluronic acid contains the correct standardized level of purity and active ingredients. We also test each batch for any possible additives, contaminants, and impurities to ensure the highest level of quality.



Quality, first, and foremost: In order to meet the highest regulatory standards, Toniiq products are produced in a GMP-certified and NSF-approved state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Florida. Our products are vegan-friendly, have no additional preservatives, and are free of wheat and gluten.*

Two-In-One Formula | Adrenal & Thyroid Support - Because the adrenal glands and thyroid work closely together, we were shocked to find that no supplements support both. So we developed one that did. WellPath Soothe was expertly developed to include powerful natural ingredients that help fight complexes like adrenal fatigue and thyroid irregularities.



Balance Your Mind & Body - Does your body feel like it’s overstressed and running in overdrive? Our busy lifestyles invite unwanted stress into our lives, and throw our bodies off their ideal hormonal balance. Ditch that “tired and wired” feeling to support your energy levels, aid mental relaxation, and help fight occasional brain fog!



Herbal Ingredient Formula - Our adrenal and thyroid support formula is handpicked by experts to help regulate and balance our bodies. Our formula includes Ashwagandha Root extract, an Ayurvedic herb famed for balancing stress; Eleuthero, an herb known for regulating cortisol levels, the energy boosting Rhodiola Rosea, L-Tyrosine, Selenium, Kelp and more.



Safety & Quality Are Our Top Priority - Soothe is entirely non-GMO, gluten free, and soy free in a vegetarian capsule. It is third-party tested and manufactured in a GMP-certified facility.

About this item



5-HTP enhanced super formula - We supplemented 200mg of pure 5-HTP with clinically proven serotonin synthesizers, SAMe and L Tryptophan. Tryptophan is metabolized into 5-HTP in the body, while SAMe is a well-known serotonin booster. In addition, both ingredients have been indicated to help 5-HTP conversion to serotonin, creating the ideal synergistic mood booster.



B6 for improved serotonin conversion - Our formula includes a high dosage of Vitamin B6, the main co-factor necessary to convert 5-HTP into serotonin. Vitamin B6 has been clinically shown to aid 5-HTP conversion into serotonin, while even slight B6 deficiency can greatly inhibit the efficacy of 5-HTP.



Mood, anxiety & sleep support - 5-HTP is the primary precursor to serotonin production in the body. Increased levels of serotonin have been scientifically shown to promote positive mood, anxiety relief and better sleep.



Doctor-driven, science backed - Bringing Dr. Emil’s unique knowledge as both a medical doctor & recognized authority in the supplementation field (he’s also a former pro athlete!), our blends are painstakingly formulated to provide superior results and are always backed by science - free of gimmicks, fads & false promises.



Only the right stuff - All Dr. Emil products are made from all-natural vitamins, minerals & herbal extracts, without the use of harmful additives; NON-GMO and free of hormones, gluten. All products are manufactured in the USA in a GMP certified laboratory.

About this item



CLINICALLY-SUPPORTED FORMULATION: The Bone Builder Pack has both AlgaeCal Plus and Strontium Boost. A full serving of the AlgaeCal Plus calcium formula contains 720mg of plant-based calcium and 350mg of magnesium. It's also the ONLY calcium supplement backed by three human clinical studies.



TRIPLE BONE BUILDING: Taking Strontium Boost together with AlgaeCal Plus has been shown to 3x bone density increases



ESSENTIAL VITAMINS AND MINERALS: We supercharge our supplement by adding 1600IUs of vitamin D3, 100mcg of vitamin K2 MK7, 50mg of vitamin C, and 3mg of Boron. These ingredients are essential for good bone health and play a critical role in calcium absorption.



PLANT-BASED: Since we derive our calcium from a whole food source (raw marine algae), it naturally contains 13+ trace minerals which further boost bone-building. The raw marine algae we use is simply sun-dried and then ground up into a fine powder for maximum effectiveness.



STRONGER BONES AT ANY AGE: Even 80+ year olds with osteoporosis have seen improvements in their bone density with the Bone Builder Pack



MANUFACTURED IN THE USA: We believe in only using top quality ingredients, so we manufacture right here in the USA. Capsules are veggie-based. Dairy Free, Soy Free, Gluten Free and Non-GMO.

About this item



LEAKY GUT REPAIR SUPPLEMENT POWDER - GutAssist supports the healing of the body’s protective membranes along the GI tract, giving these membranes nutrients like L-Glutamine to thrive and heal.



IMMUNE SYSTEM SUPPORT - Good health really does start in the gut. Poor gut health can even lead to a bad mood, depression, and other imbalances that effect the quality of our lives. Maintaining good gut flora and balance is essential for proper digestive health and gut integrity. Inside your body, the gut wall houses many cells that comprise your immune system.



GI TRACT + DIGESTIVE SUPPORT - A healthy gut lining supports nutrient delivery, and a well-balanced digestive tract is essential to achieving good nutrient delivery. An imbalanced gut can lead to complications like bloating, IBS, constipation, diarrhea, cramps, or gas. A poorly functioning gut can also disrupt the balance and harmony of our body, sometimes leading to a bad mood, depression, anxiety, or stress.



GLUTAMINE, ALOE VERA, LICORICE ROOT, ARABINOGALACTAN - L-Glutamine is the body’s most plentiful free-form amino acid, and is central in sustaining gastrointestinal function. Glutamine is a significant carrier of nitrogen within the body, which is essential in the cellular healing.



CAN BE TAKEN WITH PROBIOTICS, DIGESTIVE ENZYMES, PREBIOTICS - When leaky gut occurs a person may experience an almost allergic-level response to these offending food particles or bacteria that have leaked through the gut wall into the bloodstream. The result can be uncomfortable gastrointestinal symptoms such as cramps, gas, extreme food sensitivity, bloating, abnormal bowel movements, and inflammation. A leaky gut can also manifest itself in other ways.

About this item



WHAT IS NAD? - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD+, is a coenzyme found in all living cells. It's a key component for the fundamental biological processes that make life possible. The problem is, as we age, NAD+ levels start to decline. Recent studies have verified there are tremendous health benefits to boosting NAD+.



BENEFITS OF NAD(3) - NAD(3) impacts all the key areas of cell health: It boosts NAD+ the crucial co-enzyme for Mitochondrial function. Activates Sirtuins, the healthy-aging and survival protein. Increases Telomerase activity to protect DNA. And influences NLRP3 expression to control cellular inflammation.



THE WORLD’S MOST EFFECTIVE NAD+ BOOSTER – The studies are in & the research is very clear, while nicotinamide riboside is effective, it is not the best cell health product on the market. NAD(3) has advanced the science of NR - and revolutionized health from within.



THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF HPN’s BEST SELLING NIAGEN PRODUCT - In 2013, High Performance Nutrition released a product that changed everything we thought we knew about anti aging & longevity; NAD(3) is the next, clinically superior evolution



INDEPENDENTLY TESTED BY THE BSCG - NAD(3) is made in the USA with NSF cGMP certified manufacturing and independently tested for guaranteed purity and quality with every bottle

Fatigue is one of the first signs of a deficiency as Potassium as it is responsible for energy production.
